# Challenge-1
Challenge of week 1, first homework assignment.
The application is a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.
I struggling with getting the file from local to being accessable by anyone.
The header works to quickly get to whatever part of the page is desired.
I hope to be able to in the future make the website more friendly for different sized screens such as a mobile device.
